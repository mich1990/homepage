          The BMW 3 Series (E21) is a line of cars made by BMW from 1975 through
          1983, the first generation of the 3 Series. The E21 eventually
          succeeded the 02 Series (1966–1977). It was followed by the
          second-generation E30 (1982–1994), continuing on to the current
          seventh generation G20 (since 2019). Initial models were produced in a
          two-door sedan body style with four-cylinder petrol engines.
          Fuel-injected engines were introduced in late 1975 and 6-cylinder
          engines were added in 1977.[3] A cabriolet body style — manufactured
          by Baur— was produced from 1978 to 1981. There was no BMW M3 model for
          the E21 generation, but several limited edition models were produced
          based on the top version, the six-cylinder 323i.
