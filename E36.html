                The BMW E36 is the third generation of the BMW 3 Series range of compact executive cars, and was
                produced from 1990 to 2000. The initial models were of the four-door sedan body style, followed by the
                coupe, convertible, wagon ("Touring") and hatchback ("Compact") bodystyles in later years.

                The E36 was the first 3 Series to be offered in a hatchback bodystyle. It was also the first 3 Series to
                be available with a six-speed manual transmission (in the 1996 M3), a five-speed automatic transmission
                and a four-cylinder diesel engine. The multi-link rear suspension was also a significant upgrade as
                compared to the previous generations of the 3 Series.

                The E36 was named in Car and Driver magazine's 10Best list for every year it was on sale.[2]

                The high performance E36 M3 is powered by the BMW S50 or BMW S52 straight-six engine (depending on
                country). The E36 M3 was introduced in 1992 and was available in coup√©, sedan and convertible
                bodystyles.

                Following the introduction of its successor, the E46 3 Series in 1998, the E36 began to be phased out
                and was eventually replaced in 1999.
