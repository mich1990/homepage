      <p>Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG was formed in 1916. This company was renamed to Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) in
        1922. However the name BMW dates back to 1913, when the original company to use the name BMW was born (initially
        as Rapp Motorenwerke). BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa. Following the
        end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items
        and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the BMW R 32 in 1923.
        BMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach, which, at the time,
        built Austin Sevens under licence under the Dixi marque.[3] The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged Dixi
        called the BMW 3/15, following BMW's acquisition of the car manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the
        1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.

        Aircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the war,
        against the wishes of its director Franz Josef Popp[citation needed], BMW concentrated on aircraft engine
        production using forced labor consisting primarily of prisoners from concentration camps, with motorcycles as a
        side line and automobile manufacture ceased altogether. BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and
        its remaining West German facilities were banned from producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. Again,
        the company survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW
        resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the BMW 501 luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in
        1955, through the production of the cheaper Isetta microcar under licence. Slow sales of luxury cars and small
        profit margins from microcars meant BMW was in serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly
        taken over by rival Daimler-Benz. A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the
        company surviving as a separate entity. The BMW 700 was successful and assisted in the company's recovery.

        The 1962 introduction of the BMW New Class compact sedans was the beginning of BMW's reputation as a leading
        manufacturer of sport-oriented cars. Throughout the 1960s, BMW expanded its range by adding coupe and luxury
        sedan models. The BMW 5 Series mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the BMW 3 Series compact
        sedans in 1975, the BMW 6 Series luxury coupes in 1976 and the BMW 7 Series large luxury sedans in 1978.

        The BMW M division released its first road car, a mid-engine supercar, in 1978. This was followed by the BMW M5
        in 1984 and the BMW M3 in 1986. Also in 1986, BMW introduced its first V12 engine in the 750i luxury sedan.

        The company purchased the Rover Group in 1994, however the takeover was not successful and was causing BMW large
        financial losses. In 2000, BMW sold off most of the Rover brands, retaining only the Mini brand.

        In 1998, BMW also acquired the rights to the Rolls Royce brand from Vickers Plc.

        The 1995 BMW Z3 expanded the line-up to include a mass-production two-seat roadster and the 1999 BMW X5 was the
        company's entry into the SUV market.

        The first mass-produced turbocharged petrol engine was introduced in 2006, with most engines switching over to
        turbocharging over the following decade. The first hybrid BMW was the 2010 BMW ActiveHybrid 7, and BMW's first
        electric car was the BMW i3 city car, which was released in 2013. After many years of establishing a reputation
        for sporting rear-wheel drive cars, BMW's first front-wheel drive car was the 2014 BMW 2 Series Active Tourer
        multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).

          The BMW 3 Series (E21) is a line of cars made by BMW from 1975 through 1983, the first generation of the 3
          Series. The E21 eventually succeeded the 02 Series (1966–1977). It was followed by the second-generation E30
          (1982–1994), continuing on to the current seventh generation G20 (since 2019).

          Initial models were produced in a two-door sedan body style with four-cylinder petrol engines. Fuel-injected
          engines were introduced in late 1975 and 6-cylinder engines were added in 1977.[3] A cabriolet body style —
          manufactured by Baur— was produced from 1978 to 1981.

          There was no BMW M3 model for the E21 generation, but several limited edition models were produced based on
          the top version, the six-cylinder 323i.

        <p> The BMW E30 is the second generation of BMW 3 Series, which was produced from 1982-1994 and replaced the E21
          3 Series.

          The model range included coupé and convertible body styles,[4][5] as well as being the first 3 Series to be
          produced in sedan and wagon/estate body styles. It was powered by four-cylinder petrol, six-cylinder petrol
          and six-cylinder diesel engines, the latter a first for the 3 Series. The E30 325iX model was the first 3
          Series to have all-wheel drive.

          The first BMW M3 model was built on the E30 platform and was powered by the high-revving BMW S14 four-cylinder
          petrol engine, which produced 175 kW (235 bhp) in its final European-only iteration.[6] The BMW Z1 roadster
          was also based on the E30 platform.

          Following the launch of the E36 3 Series in 1990, the E30 began to be phased out. <br>

          The BMW E36 is the third generation of the BMW 3 Series range of compact executive cars, and was
          produced from 1990 to 2000. The initial models were of the four-door sedan body style, followed by the
          coupe, convertible, wagon ("Touring") and hatchback ("Compact") bodystyles in later years.

          The E36 was the first 3 Series to be offered in a hatchback bodystyle. It was also the first 3 Series to
          be available with a six-speed manual transmission (in the 1996 M3), a five-speed automatic transmission
          and a four-cylinder diesel engine. The multi-link rear suspension was also a significant upgrade as
          compared to the previous generations of the 3 Series.

          The E36 was named in Car and Driver magazine's 10Best list for every year it was on sale.[2]

          The high performance E36 M3 is powered by the BMW S50 or BMW S52 straight-six engine (depending on
          country). The E36 M3 was introduced in 1992 and was available in coupé, sedan and convertible
          bodystyles.

          Following the introduction of its successor, the E46 3 Series in 1998, the E36 began to be phased out
          and was eventually replaced in 1999.
