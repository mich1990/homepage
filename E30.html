                The BMW E30 is the second generation of BMW 3 Series, which was produced from 1982-1994 and replaced the E21 3 Series.

                The model range included coup√© and convertible body styles,[4][5] as well as being the first 3 Series to be produced in sedan and wagon/estate body styles. It was powered by four-cylinder petrol, six-cylinder petrol and six-cylinder diesel engines, the latter a first for the 3 Series. The E30 325iX model was the first 3 Series to have all-wheel drive.
                
                The first BMW M3 model was built on the E30 platform and was powered by the high-revving BMW S14 four-cylinder petrol engine, which produced 175 kW (235 bhp) in its final European-only iteration.[6] The BMW Z1 roadster was also based on the E30 platform.
                
                Following the launch of the E36 3 Series in 1990, the E30 began to be phased out.
